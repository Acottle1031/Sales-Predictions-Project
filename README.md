# Big Mart Sales
## Predicting Sales for Big Mart 

**Author**: Austin Cottle

### Business problem: 

Our goal here is to create a prediction model for the sales of food items sold at various Big Mart locations


### Data:
Source: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

This data set includes information regarding the sales of products across Big Mart locations over the course of the business life. Including amount of sales, outlet types and tiers, the years the outlet was established and the types of items being sold, among others that are not too useful for us for what we want to do here.



## Methods
- Here we choose to use a Decision Tree model to make predictions. A Decision Tree model is essentially a tool used to make predictions by building series of nodes based on similar features, those nodes are then divided into smaller subsets depending on how deep the model is tuned, and a prediction is made based on the trimmed data.


## Analysis

#### Sales By Item

This image shows us the sales by item, letting us know that our items that sell the most will be our Fruits & Vegetables, with Snack Foods coming in a very close 2nd.


#### Sales over time

#### Predictions using scatter plot

This visual shows us our predictions and in what range they fall.






## Limitations 
This model does make mistakes, our errors for sales predictions are about $1,092.30
