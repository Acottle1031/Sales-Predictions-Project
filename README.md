# Big Mart Sales
## Predicting Sales for Big Mart 

**Author**: Austin Cottle

### Business problem: 

Our goal here is to create a prediction model for the sales of food items sold at various Big Mart locations


### Data:
Source: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

This data set includes information regarding the sales of products across Big Mart locations over the course of the business life. Including amount of sales, outlet types and tiers, the years the outlet was established and the types of items being sold, among others that are not too useful for us for what we want to do here.



## Methods
- Here we choose to use a linear regression method to make predictions. A linear regression model is essentially a tool used to study the relationship between independent variables (in our case variables such as our item types) and our dependent variable (in this case, our sales).   We're going to use this model because, after testing against other available models, the linear regression model was the best fit as other available models showed they were more prone to errors, and larger errors at that.


## Results

#### Predictions using scatter plot

This visual shows us our predictions and in what range they fall.

#### Sales by Item

This visual shows us the sales by item, showing us that Fruits & Veggies sell the most with Snack Foods coming in 2nd 





## Limitations 
This model does make mistakes, our errors for sales predictions are about $1,092.30
